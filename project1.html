    <h2>Small Office Network Infrastructure with POS Integration</h2>
    <img src="images/packettracer.png" alt="Project 1" class="img-fluid">
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this project, I was responsible for designing a complete networking solution for a retail environment that needed both a reliable Point of Sale (POS) system and a backroom office network. The setup included both wireless connectivity for mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) used in the POS system and wired connections for office PCs and a shared printer. My aim was to create a secure, scalable network that would ensure seamless day-to-day operations, aligning the structure with what I learned in my coursework on networking fundamentals.</p>
    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Router & Switches formed the backbone of the network, handling traffic between the POS system, backroom office, and internet, ensuring smooth, fast communication. The Wireless Router provided Wi-Fi access to the POS devices, allowing mobile tablets and smartphones to operate without interruptions. The configuration involved applying concepts from my Systems Analysis and Design class where I honed my skills on creating and maintaining secure network connections. Gigabit Ethernet was used for fast and reliable communication between office devices, including PCs and the printer.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Balancing security with usability was one challenge, as the network needed to handle sensitive transaction data without slowing down operations. I also had to integrate wireless and wired networks effectively, ensuring both types of devices worked harmoniously by using subnetting techniques from my coursework.</p>
    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> Network segmentation was implemented by creating separate subnets for the POS system and the backroom office, improving security and organization. Wireless optimization was another key solution, ensuring stable connections for multiple mobile devices by minimizing interference and maximizing coverage.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The final network was highly efficient, ensuring smooth communication between the POS devices and the office equipment. The use of segmentation and wireless optimization not only boosted performance but also ensured scalability for future business needs. This project solidified many of the practical skills I gained through my coursework, particularly in the areas of network design and security.</p>
